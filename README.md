# Tasks

Task 1-
->The code iterates over the list of orders and creates a new list, m, which is an empty list.
->The code then iterates over each value in the c array and creates a new tuple with two elements: one for the order number and one for its corresponding values.
->The code then iterates over each element in i (the original list) to create a new tuple with three elements: one for the order number, one for its corresponding values, and another element that will be used as an index into j's values.
->The code will print the following list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 3]

Test
Model	Accuracy	AUC
0	Logistic Regression	98.8	0.756539
1	Naive Bayes Classifier	92.4	0.881958
2	SVC(Support Vector Classification)	50.8	0.500000
3	Random Forest	99.4	0.755533
4	k-Nearest Neighbors	97.6	0.764588

In  both Train and Test -  Random Forest method accuracy was higher
